<h2>Type of tests</h2>
<p>Falls in 2 categories: unit testing and intgration testing.</p>
<p>Unit testing is very fined-grained, testing single components to make sure they function properly. Integration testing tests the inteaction between multiple components, or even the whole system.</p>
<h2>HTTP Request Methods<h2>
<p>The HTTP protocol defines a collection of <em>request methods</em> often refreed to as HTTP verbs, that a client uses to communicate with a server. Far and away, the most common methods are GET and POST.</p>
<p>When you type a URL into a browser (or click a link), the browser issues an HTTP GET request to the server. The important information passed to the server is the URL path and querystring. The combination of method, path, and querystring is what your app uses to determine how to respond.</p>
<p>For a website, most of your pages will respond to GET requests. POST requests are usually
reserved for sending information back to the server (form processing, for example). Itâ€™s
quite common for POST requests to respond with the same HTML as the corresponding
GET request after the server has processed any information included in the request, like a form.</p>
